# Abstract
Inventory management is a fundamental problem in supply chain optimization, involving decisions
on ordering and maintaining stock levels to maximize profitability while minimizing costs. This
paper aims to address the single-product inventory management problem under uncertain demand
using reinforcement learning techniques, specifically Q-learning, and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The
proposed approach is compared with the traditional (s,S) policy, which establishes a reorder point s
and target inventory levels S. We present the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), discuss
all approaches, conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the results, and present insights into the
efficacy of using reinforcement learning for inventory optimization.
